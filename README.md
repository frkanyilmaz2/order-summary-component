## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I literally wasted hours to solve the curved background. Only to discover that the pattern was already provided. Still I learned what is a svg path editor and how to use it. 

### Continued development

I need to get better at responsive development. I messed this one. I also need to improve my knowledge about layouts.
